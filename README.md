Mobile-Robotics-
================
This repository contains code that I wrote for my mobile robotics class. 
I have included 3 scripts that I consider most significant, each covering a particular theme in mobile robotics. 

1) drive_course.py
This code is used to navigate our turtle_bot (type of mobile robot) in a class-wide robotics obstacle race. 
We completed the course in 40 seconds, making us a top 3 finisher. 

2) pure_pursuit.py
This code implements and simulates the pure_pursuit algorithm, a common technique used for navigating robots 
towards a goal. 

3) lqr.py
This code implements the lqr (linear quadratic regulator) algorithm and calculates the control matrices
used to navigate the robot.
